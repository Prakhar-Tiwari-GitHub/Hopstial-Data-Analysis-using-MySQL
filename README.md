# Hospital Data Analysis using MySQL

This project performs an in-depth analysis of hospital data stored in CSV files using MySQL. The goal is to generate insights into hospital operations, patient care, doctor performance, billing details, and treatment effectiveness. The project leverages SQL queries to analyze data from various aspects of hospital management.

## Datasets:
The following CSV files are analyzed as part of the project:

- **Appointments.csv** – Contains data related to patient appointments, including scheduled dates, patient information, and doctor assignments.
- **Billing.csv** – Contains billing information for each patient, including charges, payment status, and payment methods.
- **Doctors.csv** – Includes information about the doctors, such as specialties, experience, and the number of appointments handled.
- **Patients.csv** – Contains patient demographics, medical history, and contact details.
- **Treatments.csv** – Contains records of treatments administered to patients, including treatment types, dates, and related medical staff.

## Key Features:
- **Patient Appointment Analysis**: Analyze trends in patient appointments, appointment no-shows, and doctor availability.
- **Billing Insights**: Identify patterns in billing, payment methods, and outstanding payments.
- **Doctor Performance**: Measure doctor efficiency and patient satisfaction based on treatments and appointments.
- **Patient Treatment Outcomes**: Evaluate the success of different treatments and recovery rates across patient demographics.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Perform data preprocessing steps to ensure data integrity and consistency.

## Technologies Used:
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Tools**: SQL Workbench, Data Visualization tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) [if used]
